# ============================================================
# .gitattributes (Keep files consistent across operating systems)
# ============================================================

# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .gitattributes.
# WHY: Ensure consistent line endings, diff behavior, and file classification
# across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
# ALT: Repository may omit .gitattributes ONLY if equivalent normalization is
# enforced reliably by tooling and CI (rare and fragile).
# CUSTOM: Update file-type rules only when introducing new languages,
# binary artifacts, or documentation formats.
# NOTE: Rules are ordered by impact and generality, not alphabetically.
# Git attributes are documented at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

# === Core defaults (always apply) ===

# WHY: Auto-detect text files and normalize line endings to avoid cross-platform drift.
* text=auto

# === Text files where LF really matters ===
# CUSTOM: Do not add .md files here - web edits require different handling.

*.yml   text eol=lf
*.yaml  text eol=lf
*.html  text eol=lf
*.css   text eol=lf
*.scss  text eol=lf
*.js    text eol=lf
*.json  text eol=lf

# === Binary files (never modify line endings) ===

*.png   binary
*.jpg   binary
*.jpeg  binary
*.gif   binary
*.svg   binary
*.ico   binary
*.pdf   binary

# === GitHub Linguist classification ===

# WHY: Exclude documentation and tests from GitHub repo language statistics.
